The objective of this project is aid migration from sbt v0.13 to v1.0.
In particular, the objective is to allow
[scalafix](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalafix)
to use the Scalameta [Semantic API](http://scalameta.org/tutorial/#SemanticAPI)
for accurate source rewriting of sbt build files.
This project is not intended to be used for other purposes.

This project consists of two modules:

- semanticdb-sbt: a compiler plugin for Scala 2.10 that emits `.semanticdb` files
  (see [Semantic DB](http://scalameta.org/tutorial/#SemanticDB)) during compilation.
  semanticdb-sbt only emits offset positions and it does not make an effort to
  disambiguate between resolved names in conflicting positions.
- semanticdb-sbt-runtime: a 2.11/2.12 library that modifies/patches `.semanticdb` files,
  produced by semanticdb-sbt. semanticdb-sbt-runtime is used by applications like
  scalafix at *runtime*, as opposed to compile-time during creation of
  `.semanticdb` files.  semanticdb-sbt-runtime does a best-effort of converting the
  emitted offset positions into range positions as well as to disambiguate
  between names at conflicting positions.

Note. The codebase still has occasional references to sbthost, which is
the old name of semanticdb-sbt.
